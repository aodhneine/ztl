# ztl

This is a repository of header-only, single-file libraries -- something like [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb),
but in C++, with templates. duh.

The list of libraries is below:


# what

library | description
--------|------------
zpr     | type-safe printf; std::format for C++17, but not so bloated and overkill


# use

Each header file is standalone, and includes minimal headers from the C++ STL. Just copy and paste it into
your project, as header-only libraries should be.
